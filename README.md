Wild Plants Edibility Prediction using IBM Watson Studio
The rural communities of developing countries depend on wild edible plants to meet their food requirements during periods of food shortage. Wild edible plants are mostly serving as supplementary foods in different parts of the world because they are nutritionally rich and can supplement especially vitamins and micronutrients. The main objective of this project is to build Convolutional neural networks are a deep model to detect and classify the edibility of the wild plant. The model also suggests the effects of non-edible wild plant produce.
We are creating a web application where the user selects the image which is to be classified. The image is fed into the model that is trained and the predicted class will be displayed on the webpage.Video.https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-BidaAbg9KCPRJCbkdwp6Cf0YaSBEued/view?usp=drivesdk
